Project Goals
=============

The ultimate goal of this project is to produce a totally _new_ Grateful Dead live concert that is indistinguisable from a real concert.

Understandably, this is quite tricky so the short term goals are a little simple, and include some other GD projects to aid with experimentation and learning.

Short Term Goals
----------------

The current short term goals of the project are:

* Write a program that can discriminate between aud and sbd recordings
* Write a program that can discriminate between GD and non GD
* Write a program that can "fill-in" small gaps in GD music (pops, clicks etc)
* Write a program that converts aud samples to sbd samples

All of these goals must use sound files, and not rely on any conversion where data is lost (for example, Mel spectrograms)
