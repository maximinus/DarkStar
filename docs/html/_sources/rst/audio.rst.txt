Preparing Audio
===============

Ensure that all audio is stored under the /music folder (these files are not hosted on github).

Make sure that tracks such as "dead air", "audience", "tuning" and so forth are deleted.

They should all be 16-bit 44.1kHz WAV files.

Different experiments will need different audio files, but in general we normalise, slice and convert to raw audio file before training.
